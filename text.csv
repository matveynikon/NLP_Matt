The people who vote in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference we'll have more citizens voting if the electoral college is abolished.

Opinion/Belief,"['Another reason I think it is good to get advice from more than one person is because people can try to tell you the wrong thing', ' This could make things worse because they are giving you bad advice', ' That means they are not trying to help you but, they want you to do the wrong thing instead of what is better for you', ' If a person who does not like you gives you advice it can mostly likely mean they want you to fail or make a bad choice', ' When people get advice from many different people they will not have this problem', ' Therefore people who who have not been through what you have going through can not really relate or understand what is going on', ' This means you want advice from people who really knows how to help']"

Opinion/Belief,"['In the electoral college who really has a voice apparently not the people. In the article ""What is the Electoral College "" author ""The Office Of The Federal register"" it proclaims "" You help\xa0 choose your state electors when you vote for president because when you chose your canditate you actually vote for your candidates electors. It is evident that many people really not dont know who there ""voting"" for in the democratic government . We have discovered the decision isn\'t in\xa0 the people hands , but did we think about how ""the electors could always defy the will of the people"" in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" author Bradford Plumer says , and he makes a valid point no matter if your candidate wins by a landslide the electors still choose who becomes president.', '']"
